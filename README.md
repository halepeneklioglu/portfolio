# Data Scientist

### About me
I am a dedicated Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Python programming, SQL, and machine learning, built on over a decade of experience in education. Having transitioned from a role as an educator to data science, I excel in analyzing complex datasets, developing predictive models, and applying statistical insights to solve real-world problems.

My portfolio includes projects in customer segmentation, predictive modeling, and recommendation systems, using techniques such as regression, classification, A/B testing, and collaborative filtering. I have worked on diverse datasets including Amazon, IMDB, and online retail, and am passionate about transforming data into actionable insights that drive business decisions.

With a proven ability to communicate complex data insights clearly, I aim to bridge the gap between technical analysis and business solutions. I thrive in environments that value creativity, collaboration, and continuous learning, and I am eager to contribute my skills to projects that make a meaningful impact.
